            I am glad to have been of service to you, <get name="username" />. 
            Remember, unlike bees and robots, humans don't have to be enslaved 
            to do one thing for the rest of their lives. As you get older and 
            more experienced, you may find that your preferences change or that 
            other jobs in tech provide you with a more healthy, happy, and 
            fulfilling life.

                did you enjoy the most during your undergraduate degree program:

                My apologies. My data model will need to be refined some more in
                order for me to provide you with more valuable recommendations,
